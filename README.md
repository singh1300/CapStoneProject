Warehouse Employee Performance and Training Platform

Overview

What is your app?

The Warehouse Employee Performance and Training Platform is a web application designed to help warehouse employees track their performance, view their productivity reports, and access training modules to improve their skills. The app includes features such as performance dashboards, order details, training videos, and error tracking.

Problem

Warehouse employees often struggle to find items in bins, leading to repeated scanning of wrong items, which impacts productivity and performance. This app aims to address these issues by providing employees with a tool to monitor their performance, identify mistakes, and receive training to improve accuracy and efficiency.

User Profile

	•	Primary Users: Warehouse employees
	•	Secondary Users: Warehouse managers
	•	Usage: Employees will use the app to log in, check their performance metrics, view order details, and access training modules. Managers may use the app to monitor employee performance and identify areas for improvement.
	•	Special Considerations: The app should be user-friendly, accessible on various devices, and provide real-time updates on performance metrics.

Features

	1.	Login Page: Employees can log in to access their personalized dashboard.
	2.	Dashboard: Displays daily and weekly work reports, including items picked, mistakes made, and performance graphs.
	3.	Training Page: Provides access to training modules, including videos and text-based content.
	4.	Order Detail Page: Displays detailed information about current and past orders, including item lists and bin locations.
	5.	Error Tracking: Logs mistakes and provides recommended training modules to address specific errors.
	6.	Performance Graphs: Visual representation of employee performance over time.
	7.	Logout: Securely logs out the employee from the application.
